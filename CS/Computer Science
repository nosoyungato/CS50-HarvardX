Computer Science is about solving problems. There are inputs (what you will solve) and outputs (the solution). 

We use the decimal system where powers of ten are used. Computers us binary numbers where powers of two are used. 

In decimal system this is how you show number three

0 0 3

In binary, you show it like this

0 1 1

Because the second space is 2^1 = 2 and each space (each bit) can only be 0 or 1
